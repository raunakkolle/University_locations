Using the Google Places API with a Database and
Visualizing Data on Google Map

In this project, we are using the Google geocoding API
to clean up some user-entered geographic locations of
university names and then placing the data on a Google
Map.

The first problem to solve is that the Google geocoding
API is rate limited to a fixed number of requests per day.
So if you have a lot of data you might need to stop and
restart the lookup process several times.  

This project includes the locations of locations of several universities 
which have been added to the database.

If you want to add more locations, add them in the database as per your requirements.
